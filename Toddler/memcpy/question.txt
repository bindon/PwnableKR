Are you tired of hacking?, take some rest here.
Just help me out with my small experiment regarding memcpy performance. 
after that, flag is yours.

http://pwnable.kr/bin/memcpy.c

ssh memcpy@pwnable.kr -p2222 (pw:guest)

the compiled binary of "memcpy.c" source code (with real flag) will be executed under memcpy_pwn privilege if you connect to port 9022.
execute the binary by connecting to daemon(nc 0 9022).
